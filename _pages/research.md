Despite the global nature of changes in climate, local weather shocks have been shown to be detrimental only to local economic activity. This paper introduces the role of input-output sectoral interlinkages as a transmission mechanism of weather shocks in a production network model and tests the empirical implications using a six-sector global dataset from 1975 to 2020. First, I document that agriculture is the most harmed sector by a range of weather shocks, including hot days, droughts, and cyclones. Second, I find that sectors at later stages of the supply chain, though non-responsive to local weather fluctuations, suffer from substantial and persistent losses over time due to heat shocks in agriculture that propagate downstream through sectoral interlinkages. Using counterfactual scenarios, I show a substantial underestimation of the economic cost of temperature increases accounting for heat shocks across trade partners since 2000 and I characterize global losses depending on the sectoral centrality in the production network.

**Adapting to climate change accounting for individual beliefs** <br/> [Draft available upon request] <br/> (Previously circulated as "Do subjective perceptions shape adaptation to climate change? Evidence from Bangladesh")

<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Mounting evidence that climate is changing requires a better understanding of how individuals adapt. Despite a large number of studied adaptation gaps, including financial and technological constraints, the adaptive decision-making process has still been relying on perfect information and optimal climate beliefs assumptions. Combining a survey of rural households in Bangladesh with a meteorological measure of dryness, this paper studies the role of individual beliefs about droughts on irrigation use. I formalize a theoretical framework of behavioral inattention to examine how farmers' beliefs differentially influence responsiveness to dryness exposure. When testing the implications empirically, I document a positive effect in drier areas, with heterogeneous responses by growing seasons and types of irrigation. I explore three cognitive mechanisms, exploiting the intensity and frequency of drought events and comparing self-reported and objective records. In a counterfactual analysis with beliefs based on meteorological conditions, I show that farmers underuse irrigation and incur substantial monetary losses as a result of inaccurate beliefs, generating a belief gap.

**Climate-induced migration and environmental values** <br/> [Draft available upon request]

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Weather fluctuations can substantially affect international migration, yet little is known about the political implications of climate-induced flows in host countries. This study examines the impact of weather-induced asylum applications on individual climate concern and voting behavior for Green parties in the European Union between 2000 and 2019. Using a combination of survey data, electoral outcomes, and pro-environment policy platforms, the paper leverages exogenous variation in weather in non-OECD origin countries to construct a gravity-predicted instrument for asylum demands. The analysis reveals that weather-induced asylum applications heighten concern about climate change as a political priority. Changes in stated preferences, however, do not translate into changes in voting behavior, as there is no effect on Green party votes in the European Parliament elections. These findings are consistent with a drop-out of traditional Green voters, changes in preferences for individuals below the voting age, as well as no changes in the pro-environmental policy manifesto of political parties.

The lack of stringent policies to avert climate change has increased the importance of effective and timely adaptation. Adequate adaptation is particularly important for agricultural communities in developing countries, which may most suffer the consequences of climate change. Evidence is still scarce on how people in the most vulnerable areas form climate change beliefs and whether such beliefs exhibit cognitive biases. Using survey data from rural households in Bangladesh together with a meteorological measure of excess dryness relative to historical averages, I study the effect of long-term average drought exposure and short-term deviations on beliefs about drought frequency and the interpretation of drought events. To explore how individuals interpret past droughts, I use an instrumental variable approach and investigate whether individual beliefs lead to asymmetric distortion of objective information. The results show that individuals recollect and overweight evidence tilted towards their prior beliefs, providing evidence of confirmation bias as a directional motivated reasoning mechanism. The findings highlight the need for models that account for behavioral factors and cognitive biases in the study of climate change beliefs for effective communication and adaptation policies.

[**Happier Elderly Residents. The positive impact of physical activity on objective and subjective health condition of elderly people in nursing homes. Evidence from a multi-site randomized controlled trial**](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11482-021-09952-4.pdf) (2022) (with Claudia Senik, Carine Milcent, Chloé Gerves-Pinquié and Patricia Dargent-Molina) _Applied Research in Quality of Life_,17(2), 1091-1111

<summary> Abstract </summary>

We explore the effects of adapted physical exercise programs in nursing homes, in which some residents suffer from dementia and/or physical limitations and others do not. We use data from 452 participants followed over 12 months in 32 retirement homes in four European countries. Using a difference-in-difference with individual random effects model, we show that the program had a significant impact on the number of falls and the self-declared health and health-related quality of life of residents (EQ-5D). The wide scope of this study, in terms of sites, countries, and measured outcomes, brings generality to previously existing evidence. A simple computation, in the case of France, suggests that such programs are highly cost-efficient.
