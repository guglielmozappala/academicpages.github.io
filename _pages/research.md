**Propagation of extreme heat in agriculture across sectors and space** [Updated draft coming soon] <br/> 
(An earlier version circulated as ["Sectoral impact and propagation of weather shocks"](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/03/10/Sectoral-Impact-and-Propagation-of-Weather-Shocks-530798), _IMF Working Paper, 2023/053_)

<br>
Agriculture is widely recognized as one of the most vulnerable sectors to weather fluctuations, yet its relatively small share of global GDP suggests limited macroeconomic impacts. Since agriculture is a critical upstream sector in global supply chains, supply-side shocks in this sector induced by extreme heat might propagate through the economy by reducing input availability and increasing prices. While quantitative approaches have increasingly integrated sectoral and spatial linkages to quantify climate damages through the structure of a model, reduced form empirical designs have focused on local effects. In this paper, I develop a reduced form approach that quantifies global climate damages induced by extreme heat in agriculture accounting for input linkages across sectors and space. In a static production network model, I characterize the model-consistent sectoral exposure to upstream heat shocks. By combining quasi-experimental variation in differential crop sensitivity to hot temperatures with value added and input linkages between 1975 and 2020 around the world, I find that extreme heat in agriculture induces substantial losses to downstream sectors, across national borders and beyond first-order linkages. Counterfactual scenarios reveal a threefold underestimation of global aggregate economic costs when input linkages are omitted. The analysis highlights a positive gradient between a country's centrality in the production network and heat-induced global losses.

[**Endogenous green preferences**](/files/VZ_Endogenous_green_preferences.pdf) (with [Ravi Vora](https://sites.google.com/view/ravi-vora-)) <br/>

<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Low public support often impedes more stringent environmental policies. But if policies are enacted, do they change individual preferences? Using surveys covering 38 countries around the world, we study the effect of exposure to environmental policies on policy preferences. Exploiting within-country-year, across birth-cohort variation, we document that cohorts exposed to more stringent policies in the past are more supportive of environmental policies at the time of the survey, with the effect largely driven by exposure during early adulthood. This relationship suggests that a society’s environmental policy attitudes evolve endogenously, with implications for the frameworks we use to evaluate the normative appropriateness, predictability, and political economy of these measures.

[**Co-benefits of substance abuse regulation on temperature and intimate partner violence**](/files/PZ_Opioids.pdf) (with [Filippo Pavanello](https://fpavanello.github.io/)) <br/>

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a critical public health concern often linked to substance abuse. Environmental factors can exacerbate substance addiction and use, potentially leading to increased violence. Building on prior work showing that higher temperatures increase violent behavior, we investigate whether substance abuse regulations affect the relationship between temperature and IPV. Leveraging administrative data combined with random fluctuations in daily temperature the jurisdiction level in the United States, we document that an exogenous abuse-deterrent reformulation of opioids in 2010 significantly attenuates the temperature-IPV relationship in counties with higher initial rates of prescription opioid usage. Our main mechanism suggests an indirect reduction in the complementary use of other substances, particularly alcohol, during hot days. Our findings indicate that policies targeting substance abuse may have co-benefits in mitigating the adverse effects of temperature increases.

**Climate-induced migration and environmental values** <br/> [Draft available upon request]

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>
<br>
Climate awareness is crucial for gaining broad public support for climate policies. Previous work highlights socio-political factors and personal experience of weather shocks as the main drivers of climate attitudes. This paper introduces and empirically tests for international migration induced by weather variations as a novel determinant of climate concern in host countries. The empirical analysis leverages exogenous weather variation in non-OECD countries to construct a gravity-predicted instrument for asylum demands and shows a strong positive effect on individual climate concern in the European Union between 2000 and 2019. Google search data rule out that news and media coverage are confounding the effect of weather-induced asylum demands. Changes in stated preferences, however, do not translate into changes in voting behavior, documenting no effect on Green votes in the European Parliament elections. The findings are consistent with a drop-out of traditional Green voters, changes in preferences for individuals below the voting age, as well as no changes in the pro-environmental agenda of political parties.</details>

As the climate changes, efficient climate policy requires a better understanding of how individuals adapt. Despite extensive research on various climate adaptation frictions, including financial and technological constraints, models of adaptive decision-making assume that agents have perfect information and accurate beliefs about climate. Combining rural household data in Bangladesh with a meteorological measure of dryness, this paper studies the role of individual drought beliefs and their accuracy in irrigation decisions as a key adaptive margin. In a theoretical model, I introduce a behavioral friction to document how heterogeneous beliefs differentially influence responsiveness to the same meteorological signal in dryness. The empirical analysis reveals an asymmetric response to dry shocks in irrigation conditional on the accuracy of prior beliefs. A counterfactual analysis shows lower technology adoption levels and higher monetary losses when beliefs are inaccurate.

<br>
The lack of stringent policies to avert climate change has increased the importance of effective and timely adaptation. Adequate adaptation is particularly important for agricultural communities in developing countries, which may most suffer the consequences of climate change. Evidence is still scarce on how people in the most vulnerable areas form climate change beliefs and whether such beliefs exhibit cognitive biases. Using survey data from rural households in Bangladesh together with a meteorological measure of excess dryness relative to historical averages, I study the effect of long-term average drought exposure and short-term deviations on beliefs about drought frequency and the interpretation of drought events. To explore how individuals interpret past droughts, I use an instrumental variable approach and investigate whether individual beliefs lead to asymmetric distortion of objective information. The results show that individuals recollect and overweight evidence tilted towards their prior beliefs, providing evidence of confirmation bias as a directional motivated reasoning mechanism. The findings highlight the need for models that account for behavioral factors and cognitive biases in the study of climate change beliefs for effective communication and adaptation policies.

Evidence from a multi-site randomized controlled trial**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-021-09952-4) (2022) <br/> (with Claudia Senik, Carine Milcent, Chloé Gerves-Pinquié and Patricia Dargent-Molina) <br/> _Applied Research in Quality of Life_, 17(2), 1091-1111

We explore the effects of adapted physical exercise programs in nursing homes, in which some residents suffer from dementia and/or physical limitations and others do not. We use data from 452 participants followed over 12 months in 32 retirement homes in four European countries. Using a difference-in-difference with individual random effects model, we show that the program had a significant impact on the number of falls and the self-declared health and health-related quality of life of residents (EQ-5D). The wide scope of this study, in terms of sites, countries, and measured outcomes, brings generality to previously existing evidence. A simple computation, in the case of France, suggests that such programs are highly cost-efficient.
