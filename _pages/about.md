<img src="/images/photo.png" alt="drawing" width="350" height="280" style="float: left; padding-right:15px"/> I am a PhD candidate at the Paris School of Economics and a research fellow at IC Migrations. <br>

My research focuses on the socio-economic impact of climate change and our ability to adapt to these impacts, as well as how individuals perceive and form their attitudes towards climate and the role of beliefs in adaptive behavior. <br>

I have previously been a visiting research scholar at emLab and Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, hosted by Prof. Tamma Carleton. <br>
